.SYNOPSIS
    Compare-Diff2 (Alias: pwdiff) -- GNU diff-like file comparison.
    
    Emulates core behavior of GNU diff for comparing two text files line-by-line.

    Equivalent:
    - Reports line-level differences between two files.
    - Outputs traditional diff format (with '<' and '>' markers).
    - Automatically colorizes output for added/deleted/changed lines.

    Not Implemented:
    - Does not support diff options (-u, -c, -e, etc).
    - No intelligent block comparison or edit distance optimization.
    - No recursive directory diff.
    - No patch output format.
